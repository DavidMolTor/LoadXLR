# XLR Resistive Load

A load module for audio applications with balanced connections.

## Introduction

This module is designed to be used together with the Cosmos ADC from E1DA. It contains a set of 1-2W resistor for loading audio devices while performing performance measurements.

It contains left and right audio input and outputs via XLR connectors. Measuring probes can be connected using the PCB test points. The load value can be selected using the DIP switches.
